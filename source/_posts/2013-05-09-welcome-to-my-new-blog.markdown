So I just started this blog, using Octopress in GitHub Pages. Mostly just for testing Octopress, which I wanted to try a long time now.

It actually looks pretty neat, and I've been looking for the perfect blog engine for me for ages. I hope Octopress suffices this for me, as I still haven't got a stable blog to post about ever.

Although something of mine related to this might be in the works ;)

I just hope I don't let this blog die like all other ones I had.
